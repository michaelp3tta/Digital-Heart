<h1>Digital Heart</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a heart-shaped PCB that creates a realistic LED heartbeat pattern using analog circuitry. Built around an LM358 dual op-amp, the circuit generates oscillating pulses that are shaped into smooth heartbeat waveforms. Approximately 20 red LEDs arranged around the heart outline pulse in unison, driven by an S8050 transistor. A potentiometer allows adjustment of the heartbeat rate, while the circuit is powered by 4.5V from three AAA batteries with reverse polarity protection. The design places LEDs on the front for visual impact while hiding control electronics on the back, creating both a functional circuit and an attractive display piece.
